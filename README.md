TODO LIST

This mod should make use of GeckoLib where it can, it's a really useful tool!

##Mobs
- Nicholas the Renegade  
Model and code not started just yet.
- Elf  
Model is nearly finished, needs animating and corrections made to the model if needed then implementing.
- Ballistic Penguin  
Model for this is finished and ready in json, just needs implementing.

All three mobs attack players when in the North Pole biome.  
Nicholas the Renegade hovers around and attacks by swinging his lumbar axe at the player, he is almost as tall as an oak tree.  
Elves just attack like a zombie would when they see players.  
Ballistic Penguins when attacking propel themselves using their wings then explode on impact.  

##Dimensions
The Santas Workshop dimension is just an ender island like dimension but with daylight where it nearly always snows, it's a little misty where like a white fog.  
The only biome you will find in this dimension is the North Pole biome.  

##Biomes
The North Pole biome is the only biome in the mod for now, it's should consist of a layer of snow blocks, grass then dirt and stone.  
Only some ice trees spawn there and only the three mobs listed above and Polar Bears.
